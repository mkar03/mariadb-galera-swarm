Docker Swarm
============

This is an example only and may not be production-quality. Please submit improvements!

```
$ mkdir -p .secrets
$ openssl rand -base64 32 > .secrets/xtrabackup_password
$ openssl rand -base64 32 > .secrets/mysql_password
$ openssl rand -base64 32 > .secrets/mysql_root_password
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml galera
$ docker service ls
(wait for `galera_seed` to be healthy)
$ docker service scale galera_node=2
(wait for both `galera_node` instances to be healthy)
$ docker service scale galera_seed=0
$ docker service scale galera_node=3
```

PHPMyAdmin (optional):
```
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-phpmyadmin.yml phpmyadmin 
```

The example `docker-compose.yml` file contains a user network called `galera_network`. You may want to use a different network
that is shared with other components of your app or multiple networks. Just note that the `NODE_ADDRESS` pattern must be able
to match addresseses allocated within the network you use for inter-node communication without matching any other bound addresses.
